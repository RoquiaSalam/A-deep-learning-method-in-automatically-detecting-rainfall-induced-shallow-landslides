This collection includes both code and sample data for an experiment. Using the files provided here, you can train a deep learning segmentation model specifically tailored for analyzing high-resolution landslide datasets obtained from PlanetScope imagery. Deep learning-based U-net model is used for detecting the rainfall-induced shallow landslides in a data-sparse context. image

The model can be used to detect rainfall-induced shallow landslides in a similar geograpgic context.
